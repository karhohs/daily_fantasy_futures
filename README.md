# daily_fantasy_futures
Daily fantasy tools for predicting the scoring of DraftKings lineups. The term *futures* is used in the repository title since the relationship between drafting a player at a given salary is similar to signing a futures contract. Will the given player outperform or underperform their salary (sort of like asking if a commodity will go up or down in price)? This is the primary question motivating this project.

## Why a public repository?
If the predictions from these tools have any value, why would they be shared publicly? Primarily, because this is just for fun and sparking discussion amongst friends. Assume any predictions produced here have no value.
