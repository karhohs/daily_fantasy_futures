NFL Classic
In salary cap contests, participants will create a lineup by selecting players listed in the Player Pool.

Contest results will be determined by the total points accumulated by each individual lineup entry (scoring rules summarized below).

Participation in each contest must be made only as specified in the Terms of Use. Failure to comply with these Terms of Use will result in disqualification and, if applicable, prize forfeiture.

Player Pool
The Player Pool will consist of all NFL players expected to be on the active roster for any team scheduled to play in the contest Game Set. Occasionally a player may be missing from the Player Pool due to trades or other unforeseen circumstances.Each player listed in the player pool has an assigned salary and a valid lineup must not exceed the salary cap of $50,000.

In most circumstances, once the Player Pool is established for a Game Set, including positions and salaries, the Player Pool will not be adjusted. In the rare event that there is a mistake within the Player Pool that would significantly impact game quality, DraftKings reserves the right to correct the mistake after contests for that Game Set have become available. This may result in valid lineups becoming invalid. This would most likely occur shortly after the Player Pool becomes available, far in advance of the contest start time, and participants who have entered contests for the Game Set prior to the adjustment will be notified via email.

A "Game Set" is a set of games used for contests; each contest is tied to one Game Set. Contests tied to the same Game Set can be created at different times. Therefore, game policies are based on the timing of a Game Set being made available, not each individual contest.

Position Eligibility
Player positions are determined at the sole discretion of DraftKings.

Lineup Edits
Lineups may be edited at any time leading up to games. Each individual player will become "locked" at the scheduled start time of their team’s game. A locked player cannot be added or removed from a roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed in contest GameCenters.

If the scheduled start time for a game changes after contests for a Game Set containing that game become available, DraftKings will take measures to ensure the change is reflected on Draft Screens and for lineup editing purposes. In the rare case that a game starts before the scheduled start time, all players within that game will become locked as soon as our feed reflects that the game has begun. Additionally, any swaps that were made after the real-life start time of the game will result in those lineups being disqualified and refunded.

Cancelled, Postponed, and Rescheduled Games
In the event that a game is canceled, postponed, or rescheduled to a time outside of the original Scoring Period, the game will be disabled from the Game Set and players listed to play in that game will not be eligible to accrue points.

Players who you selected for your roster as of the time of the lock of the disabled game will remain in your roster and will accrue zero points. Players in disabled games will become locked at the originally scheduled start time of their game. For example, if the game for Player A who plays on Team X is cancelled, Player A will be locked in your roster and you will not be able to change that position and Player A will not accrue any points. The Scoring Period for NFL is defined as the timeframe between the scheduled start of the first game within the Game Set and 11:59pm ET on the first Wednesday after the last scheduled game within the Game Set.

DraftKings may choose to adjust the Scoring Period for a Game Set at their sole discretion to accommodate schedule changes at any time before 12:00am ET on the date the Game Set is scheduled. If a game is rescheduled to a time outside of the original Scoring Period, DraftKings may disable the game or adjust the Scoring Period to maintain the inclusion of the rescheduled game... For example, if a Sunday 1:00 NFL game is rescheduled to 12:55 PM, DraftKings may move the start time of the Draft Group to 12:55 PM rather than disable the whole game.

Any games that are disabled will be indicated as such on Draft Screens. Emails and other notifications may also be used to notify users of disabled games.

If canceled or rescheduled games result in a Game Set including only one active game and this is known before the contest start time then all contests for that Game Set will be canceled and refunded.

If a Game Set includes only one active game but this was not known until after the contest start time then contests for this Game Set will not be canceled.

Games are "known" to be canceled or postponed once their status is updated as such by DraftKings’ NFL stats-provider, STATS LLC.

Example: If a Game Set includes two games at 8pm ET and 10:30pm ET respectively, and the 10:30pm ET game is officially postponed at 6pm ET then all contests for that Game Set are canceled and refunded. If the 10:30pm ET game was not officially postponed until after 8pm ET then contests for that Game Set are not canceled and are played out using only the one active game.

If canceled or rescheduled games result in a Game Set including zero active games, all contests for that Game Set will be canceled and refunded.

Suspended or Shortened Games
DraftKings uses official NFL statistics and only includes statistics from games NFL deems to be official. If the NFL declares a game "suspended" then the statistics generated before the game is suspended will count in Game Sets containing said game. Any statistics generated on a later date when the game resumes will not be included.
